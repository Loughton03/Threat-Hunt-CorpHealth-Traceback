## Executive Summary
- Incident Report: Bridge Takeover & Data Exfiltration
- Incident ID: INC-2025-12-23-AZUKI
- Date: January 30, 2026
- Analyst:

## Incident Overview
This report provides a breakdown of the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) breach detected at Azuki Import/Export in November 2025. The attackers established a foothold on November 19, then paused for three days. They resurfaced on November 22 with an attack geared towards moving laterally across the network and stealing user credentials.

This report documents the complete attack chain through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry analysis, utilizing Kusto Query Language (KQL) to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY
* Data Sources:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Logs
- DeviceLogonEvents
- DeviceProcessEvents
- DeviceFileEvents
- DeviceRegistryEvents
- Analysis Period: November 19 - 25, 2025

Query Language: Kusto Query Language (KQL)

Framework: MITRE ATT&CK


## Technical Analysis
Affected Systems & Data:

- Target System: `azuki-adminpc` (CEO/Administrative Workstation).
- Compromised Accounts: `yuki.tanaka` (Primary Victim), `yuki.tanaka2` (Backdoor Account).

## Exfiltrated Data:
- Financial Records: Banking, QuickBooks, Tax, and Contract records.
- Credentials: Azuki-Passwords.kdbx (KeePass database), OLD-Passwords.txt (Plaintext), and Google Chrome Login Data.

## Evidence Sources & Analysis
- DeviceLogonEvents: Confirmed lateral movement via RDP from 10.1.0.204 using yuki.tanaka.
- DeviceProcessEvents: Revealed execution of Living-off-the-Land (LOTL) binaries (curl, robocopy, nltest) and malicious tools (m.exe, meterpreter).
- DeviceNetworkEvents: Identified C2 infrastructure (litter.catbox.moe) and exfiltration destinations (store1.gofile.io at IP 45.112.123.227).
- DeviceFileEvents: Tracked the creation of staging directories in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\staging and payload extraction in C:\Windows\Temp\cache.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
IPv4 Addresses:
- 10.1.0.204 (Internal Lateral Movement Source).
- 45.112.123.227 (Exfiltration Destination - gofile.io).</br>
Domains:
- litter.catbox.moe (Malware Hosting).
- store1.gofile.io (Exfiltration).</br>
Filenames:
- meterpreter.exe (C2 Implant).
- m.exe (Renamed Mimikatz).
- KB5044273-x64.7z (Malicious Payload masquerading as Update).
- Named Pipe: \Device\NamedPipe\msf-pipe-5902.

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause was the reuse of compromised credentials (yuki.tanaka) from a previously infected workstation, allowing attackers to move laterally via RDP to the administrative workstation. The lack of MFA on internal RDP connections facilitated this pivot.

## MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING

| Tactic           | Technique   | Procedure |
| -------------    |:-----------:| :--------:|
Initial Access	   | T1078	     |  Valid Accounts - Compromised credentials used for RDP access
Lateral Movement   | T1021.001	 |  Remote Desktop Protocol - mstsc.exe to file server
Discovery          | T1135	     |  Network Share Discovery - net.exe enumeration
Discovery	         | T1033	     |  System Owner/User Discovery - whoami.exe execution
Discovery	         | T1016	     |  System Network Configuration - ipconfig.exe execution
Defense Evasion    | T1105	     |  Ingress Tool Transfer - certutil.exe downloads
Defense Evasion    | T1036.003	 |  Masquerading - Renamed credential dumping tools
Collection	       | T1005	     |  Data from Local System - CSV/XLSX file creation
Collection	       | T1074.001	 |  Local Data Staging - robocopy.exe operations
Collection	       | T1560.001	 |  Archive via Utility - 7z.exe compression
Credential Access  | T1003.001	 |  LSASS Memory Dumping - Credential theft
Exfiltration	     | T1041	     |  Exfiltration Over C2 - curl.exe uploads
Exfiltration	     | T1567.002	 |  Cloud Storage Exfiltration - Cloud service uploads
Persistence	       | T1547.001	 |  Registry Run Keys - Autostart mechanism
Defense Evasion    | 	T1070.004	 |  File Deletion - History file removal


## Impact Analysis
- Confidentiality (Critical): Loss of sensitive financial data (banking/tax records), master passwords (Azuki-Passwords.kdbx), and browser-stored credentials.
- Integrity (High): System integrity compromised via the creation of backdoor administrative accounts and the modification of system groups.
- Availability (Low): No ransomware or destructive wiping was observed; operations were not halted.

## Response and Recovery Analysis
## Immediate Response Actions

## Eradication Measures
Malware Removal
- Identification: Search for meterpreter.exe, m.exe, and .tar.gz archives in C:\Windows\Temp\cache\ and C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\staging.
- Removal Techniques: Delete identified files and remove the yuki.tanaka2 user profile.
- Verification: Verify no active named pipes matching msf-pipe-* exist and that the rogue account is removed from the Administrators group.
System Patching
- Patch Management: Ensure all Windows updates are applied.


## Recovery Steps
Data Restoration
- Backup Validation: Ensure backups of azuki-adminpc prior to Nov 24 are clean.
- Restoration Process: Re-image azuki-adminpc is recommended due to the level of administrative compromise.
- Data Integrity Checks: Validate financial records against bank statements to ensure no tampering occurred during the breach.
System Validation
- Security Measures: Deploy EDR agents with updated rules for curl/robocopy anomalies.
- Operational Checks: Verify user access to necessary shares without using the compromised yuki.tanaka credentials.

## Post-Incident Actions
Monitoring
- Enhanced Monitoring Plans: Alert on curl.exe or tar.exe accessing Login Data or creating files in ProgramData subdirectories.
- Tools and Technologies: Tune EDR to flag Robocopy operations targeting multiple user document folders rapidly.
